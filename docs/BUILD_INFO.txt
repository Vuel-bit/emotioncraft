Build: emotioncraft_v0_2_103_passD_passA32_introBAP_autoAdvance_tapOverride
Date: 2026-02-19
Notes:
- Reworked BAP intro cutscene playback into a shot state machine with auto-advance per shot duration + tap-anywhere to advance early (Skip button still ends cutscene).
- Plate A: holds wide framing for 4.0s on line 1, then swaps to line 2 and begins a deliberate push/pan toward the helmet.
- Plate B: strict no-zoom camera; caption sequence now runs Guaranteed (5.0s) → Probably (1.5s) → Most likely (1.5s) → Hopefully (1.5s).
- Increased durations: C0(blank) 5s→7s, D 4s→6s, C1(changed) 5s→7s, E 5s→7s; C1 now performs a more aggressive pan/zoom to the upper-right sign.
- Persistence + tutorial handoff unchanged: ui.seenIntroBAP_v3 (schema v2) + sessionStorage ec_seenIntroBAP_v3; tutorial auto-start only when cutscene actually played.

Build: emotioncraft_v0_2_103_passD_passA36_spillPulses_spinCorkscrew_psycheDepthFix
Date: 2026-02-19
Notes:
- Visual-only: spill streams now communicate magnitude via discrete traveling pulses (one per ~1 unit transferred), with stable base stream widths.
- Visual-only: spin spill stream upgraded to a stronger corkscrew/helix look; spin pulses are diamond/rotating and ride the helix.
- Render telemetry: spillFx now includes a per-sim-tick sequence counter (spillFx.seq) so render can treat abs arrays as deltas without double-counting.
- Visual-only: psyche wedge depth FX revised to preserve hue identity (no mute), and animate more noticeably while keeping crisp wedge boundaries.

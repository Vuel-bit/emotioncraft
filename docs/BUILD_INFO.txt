Date: 2026-02-20
Notes: PASS A41c — UI-only polish: Transcendence timer label abbreviated (TRANSC); Debug button removed from UI (hotkey D still works); announcement line text larger; quirk activations append to Log; WIN now shows confetti burst + "Success!" overlay that animates while sim is frozen.

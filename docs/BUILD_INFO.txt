Notes:
- Visual-only: Psyche wedges now have more vivid, clearly animated "plasma depth" (additional layer + stronger motion) while keeping crisp wedge masks and preserving hue identity.
- UI (presentation-only): Traits are always shown as neutral pills; Quirks are colored text by default and switch to colored pills when ACTIVE.
- UI layout (presentation-only): Energy + timer HUD positioned using live well geometry; portrait centered above orange well; Spin-0 buttons moved into the board area with two-line labels (cost inside); drawer text capacity increased.

Notes:
- Visual-only: spin reads ~2× faster than A33 (overall ~6× vs pre-A33 baseline); scaled dir-driven motion only so spin=0 stays “alive at rest.”
- Visual-only: spill stream FX moved above wells so it is clearly visible during real spills.
- Visual-only: amount vs spin spill streams differentiated. Amount = smooth liquid ribbon + circle droplets. Spin = corkscrew/wave stream + diamond droplets, supports both positive (sOver) and negative (sUnder) spin spill.
- Spill telemetry bucket remains runtime-only (SIM._spillFx); no mechanics changes.

Date: 2026-02-19
Notes:
- BAP intro cutscene reframed so each shot starts in full “fit” view (removed negative inset enlargement; switched plates to object-fit: contain; added dark stage gradient for intentional letterboxing).
- Re-timed cutscene to a 6-shot, 31.0s timeline: A(6s) → B(6s) → C0(blank)(5s) → D(4s) → C1(changed)(5s) → E(5s), with snappier D→C1 reveal crossfade.
- Rewrote all captions per A31 spec; removed the special “label” styling/placement for “The Noodler 2000”.
- Added Plate C original as a separate asset: docs/assets/intro_bap/plate_c_blank.png, and preloaded/played both C variants.
- Persistence + tutorial handoff unchanged: ui.seenIntroBAP_v3 (schema v2) + sessionStorage ec_seenIntroBAP_v3; tutorial auto-start only when cutscene actually played.

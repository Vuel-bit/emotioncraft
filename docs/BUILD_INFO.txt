Emotioncraft Psyche MVP
Build: v0_2_99_chunk3b_partB
Date: 2026-02-12

Highlights (current build)
- Lobby-driven patient loop with INTAKE / WEEKLY / ZEN plan selection (after Intake completion).
- Total Psyche cap system removed; Psyche is per-hue only (0..500). Center core is Treatment hold timer (ring + countdown).
- PLAN_CHAIN: canonical 10s hold for all steps except SPIN_ZERO; hold requires uninterrupted satisfaction; completion flash then immediate step advance.
- Mental breaks: hue bounds (<0 or >500) and jam breaks (Amount/Spin extremes). Breaks pause the sim and show an OK modal with well-name deltas.
- Zen: 10:00 time limit (T.ZEN_TIME_LIMIT_SEC) with top-right HUD timer.
- Top HUD: 2-line patient header (Name+Traits; Quirks). Telegraph/active quirk words glow.
- Quirks: random telegraph+active system with global minimum spacing (T.DISP_MIN_GAP_SEC) to reduce constant clumping.
- Debug: default shows ONLY raw quirk force totals per well (SIM._quirkForceTotals). Input debug hidden unless ?inputdebug=1.

Notes
- Energy costs: Set-0 buttons use integer “energy units” (Math.round) for display + gating + spend; Stubborn increases costs by 1.2x.
- No-energy swipe SFX uses EC.SFX.error() (bong_001 fallback error_003).

v0.2.100 Pass A
- Fixed PLAN_CHAIN next-step drawer update (objectiveSummaryEl scope) + 3-line next step.
- Added Log overlay (pauses sim) + Log button.
- Mental breaks now hit-stop + HUD alert + render flashes; details written to Log (no popup).
- Restored psyche threshold wedge flashes (450/50).
- No-energy swipe now routes through EC.SFX.error().
- Removed fragile trait/patient.

v0.2.101 Pass B
- Sally Sadeyes now points to real portrait asset (assets/patients/sally_sadeyes.png); lobby + in-game display.
- In-game portrait overlay nudged slightly up/right (still clamped on-screen).
- Patient WIN flow: removed on-board SUCCESS banner; patient wins auto-return to lobby to show reward/congrats popups.
- Lobby: added Heroes button + Transcended overlay listing STATE.transcendedIds.

v0_2_102_passC
- Fix: Sally Sadeyes roster portrait now points to assets/patients/sally_sadeyes.png.
- Fix: Reset SIM._autoWinHandled in SIM.initMVP so auto-return on patient WIN works every run.
- Debug: Added quirk event timeline buffer (SIM._quirkTimeline) and per-instance accumulator; Debug panel now shows event-based timeline (time/type/tier/well/force).


v0_2_103_passD
- FIX: systems_dispositions.js now creates and populates SIM._quirkTimeline (authoritative) by pushing one entry per quirk instance when it ends (tStart/tEnd/dur/type/tier/hue/force). Buffer capped at 60.
- DEBUG: Debug panel timeline now timestamps by tStart (mm:ss) and gaps use start times; shows optional cadence state when available.
- TUNE: Added GLOBAL quiet/burst cadence windows for random dispositions only (Poisson-like, but modulated). Scheduled mode unchanged.
- CLEAN: disposition console logs gated behind ?dispconsole=1.

Emotioncraft Psyche MVP
Build: v0_2_103_passD
Date: 2026-02-12

Highlights (current build)
- passD Chunk 3A — warn flashes + goal sync + log + break banner cleanup.
- passD Chunk 3B — roster swap + unlock gating + start-energy progression + mood/vibe tuning + break HUD text removal.
- Lobby-driven patient loop with INTAKE / WEEKLY / ZEN plan selection (after Intake completion). Patient WIN auto-returns to Lobby to show post-win popups (no SUCCESS banner). LOSE does not auto-return.
- Psyche is per-hue only (0..500 each). Center core is the Treatment hold timer ring + countdown; it flashes red on mental breaks.
- PLAN_CHAIN: canonical 10s hold for all steps except SPIN_ZERO; hold only accumulates while all conditions are satisfied; completion flash then immediate step advance.
- Bottom drawer Treatment display: LEFT shows current step (header + up to 2 conditions; 3 lines). RIGHT shows next step in the same 3-line format.
- Energy: displayed/charged as whole units (Math.round). Set-0 buttons (Spin->0, Zero Pair) use integer energy units; display/gating/spend match.
- Log overlay: top HUD has Log button; opening Log pauses the sim (SIM._uiPaused). Mental breaks append detailed, color-coded entries (well/hue names).
- Mental breaks: no modal popup. On break: dispositions cancel, ~0.5s hit-stop, HUD line 3 shows MENTAL BREAK ~5s, center flash + affected wells/hues pulse. Break triggers: psyche hue out of bounds (<0 or >500) and jam breaks (Amount/Spin extremes).
- Psyche warning flashes (visual-only): wedge flashes 3x when a hue crosses >=450 or <=50.
- Quirks: random mode supports telegraph + active phases. Scheduling uses global min spacing (DISP_MIN_GAP_SEC) plus a global quiet/burst cadence window system (DISP_CADENCE_*).
- Debug: default debug panel shows event-based Quirk timeline (mm:ss, type, tier label, well, unshielded force, duration, gap), capped 60. Input instrumentation hidden unless ?inputdebug=1.
- Lobby: Heroes button shows Transcended patients (Zen winners). Sally Sadeyes portrait wired (assets/patients/sally_sadeyes.png). Zen timer shows in top-right during Zen (mm:ss).
